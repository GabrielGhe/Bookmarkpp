Bookmarkpp
==========

A chrome extension that allows users to search and update bookmarks with ease.

It has 3 tabs: bookmarks, changed and deleted.

The bookmarks tab has all your bookmarks, the changed tab has all the bookmarks that
you have changed (using this extension only, direct edit of a bookmark from the bookmark bar
doesn't count) and deleted (only bookmarks deleted from inside the extension appear here)
